Dominique  "Hi John, I'd like to talk to you about your contributions to the team. I've noticed that you've missed a few deadlines recently, and this is causing the team to fall behind. I understand that you may be having some challenges, but it is important to meet deadlines so that we can all stay on track. Can we work together to come up with a plan to get you back on track?"
If the person is still not meeting expectations after you have had the conversation and provided support, you may need to escalate the issue to your manager or another senior team member.
It is important to remember that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and it is possible that the person is simply not a good fit for the team or the role. If this is the case, it may be necessary to have a conversation about moving the person to a different team or role.
